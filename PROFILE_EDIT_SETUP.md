## 🗄 Supabase Database Setup

### 1. Profiles Table
Make sure your Supabase `profiles` table has these columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  bio TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can view and update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" 
  ON profiles FOR SELECT 
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" 
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE 
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" 
  ON profiles FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

### 2. Storage Bucket for Avatars
Create a storage bucket for user avatars:

```sql
-- Create the bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true);

-- Policy: Users can upload their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatar" 
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Policy: Users can update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatar" 
  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE 
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Policy: Anyone can view avatars (public)
CREATE POLICY "Avatars are publicly accessible" 
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT 
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```
